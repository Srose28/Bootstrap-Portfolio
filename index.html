I am born and raised in Nashville,TN. Nashville currently has a wide market for web development. This is part of what peaked my interest in wanting to learn more. I have an eight-year old daughter who keeps me on my toes. My daughter really motivates me to be not only the best mother, but the best person I can be. I am truly thankful God blessed me with such an amazing child.  My goal is to start a new career in web development once I graduate from the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp.
